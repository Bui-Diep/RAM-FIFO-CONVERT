/* Sure! Here's a basic program in VHDL to convert 48-bit data from RAM to 8-bit data in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) buffer. The FIFO has a depth of 16 locations, so it can store 16 8-bit values at a time. The program reads in a single 48-bit value from RAM and stores it in the FIFO by writing 6 consecutive 8-bit values to the FIFO.

Here's the code: */

-- VHDL program to convert 48-bit data from RAM to 8-bit data in a FIFO

library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity ram_to_fifo is
  port (
    clk: in std_logic;               -- clock input
    ram_data: in std_logic_vector(47 downto 0);  -- 48-bit data input from RAM
    fifo_wr_en: in std_logic;       -- FIFO write enable input
    fifo_data: out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)   -- 8-bit data output to FIFO
  );
end ram_to_fifo;

architecture behavioral of ram_to_fifo is
  -- temporary storage for 48-bit value
  signal temp: std_logic_vector(47 downto 0);
begin
  -- store 48-bit value from RAM in temporary storage
  process (clk)
  begin
    if (clk'event and clk = '1') then
      temp <= ram_data;
    end if;
  end process;

  -- write 8-bit values to FIFO
  process (clk)
  begin
    if (clk'event and clk = '1') then
      if (fifo_wr_en = '1') then
        -- write first 8-bit value to FIFO
        fifo_data <= temp(7 downto 0);

        -- write second 8-bit value to FIFO
        fifo_data <= temp(15 downto 8);

        -- write third 8-bit value to FIFO
        fifo_data <= temp(23 downto 16);

        -- write fourth 8-bit value to FIFO
        fifo_data <= temp(31 downto 24);

        -- write fifth 8-bit value to FIFO
        fifo_data <= temp(39 downto 32);

        -- write sixth 8-bit value to FIFO
        fifo_data <= temp(47 downto 40);
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;
end behavioral;

/* This program contains two processes: one to store the 48-bit value from RAM in a temporary storage signal, and another to write the 8-bit values to the FIFO. The first process runs on every clock edge and stores the value from RAM in the temporary storage signal. The second process also runs on every clock edge, and if the FIFO write enable input is high, it writes the 8-bit values to the FIFO by assigning them to the fifo_data output.

    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. */
